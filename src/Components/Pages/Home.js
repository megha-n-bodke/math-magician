      Lists of mathematics topics cover a variety of topics related to
      mathematics. Some of these lists link to hundreds of articles; some link
      only to a few. The template to the right includes links to alphabetical
      lists of all mathematical articles. This article brings together the same
      content organized in a manner better suited for browsing. Lists cover
      aspects of basic and advanced mathematics, methodology, mathematical
      statements, integrals, general concepts, mathematical objects, and
      reference tables. They also cover equations named after people, societies,
      mathematicians, journals, and meta-lists. The purpose of this list is not
      similar to that of the Mathematics Subject Classification formulated by
      the American Mathematical Society. Many mathematics journals ask authors.
